## 👋 Who We Are

**ELT Hive** is an initiative dedicated to modernizing how English teachers share, create, and adapt educational materials.

## 🚀 Our Mission

Teachers spend hours searching for materials that often need to be recreated from scratch. We are changing that with a philosophy of **"Download, Create, Fork."**

- **📚 Smart Archive:** A smart repository for editable materials. Features **Deep Search** (by grade, skill, topic) and **Smart Sharing**.
- **🔄 Fork & Remix:** Don't just download; improve a worksheet and share your version back with the community.
- **📝 Exam Builder:** A "Lego-like" **Drag-and-Drop** tool to build custom exams. Supports **PDF Generation** in minutes.

## 📦 Key Projects

### [ELT-Hive/platform](https://github.com/ELT-Hive/platform)

The core web application that powers the ELT Hive ecosystem.

- **Platform:** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- **State & Motion:** Zustand, Framer Motion, GSAP
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- **Key Features:** Material Management, Exam Builder (@dnd-kit), Smart Search

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, and teachers!

1.  **Developers:** Help us build the Exam Builder and Remix engine. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/ELT-Hive/platform/issues) in our platform repo.
2.  **Designers:** We need user-friendly UI/UX for non-tech-savvy teachers.
3.  **Teachers:** Your feedback on features is invaluable.
