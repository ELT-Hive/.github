## Who We Are

**ELT Hive** is a community-driven, open-source initiative dedicated to modernizing how K-12 English teachers in **Turkiye** share, create, and adapt educational materials.

We believe that educational resources should be **living documents**, not static files. By using a **CC0 (No Rights Reserved)** license, we ensure that every teacher and developer can freely use, adapt, and build upon this work without restriction.

## Our Mission

Teachers spend hours searching for materials that often need to be recreated from scratch. We are changing that with a philosophy of **"Download, Create, Fork."**

- **The Archive:** A smart repository for editable materials (.docx, .pptx).
- **Fork & Remix:** Don't just download; improve a worksheet and share your version back with the community.
- **Exam Builder:** A "Lego-like" tool to build custom exams from a shared question bank in minutes.
- **MEB Sync:** Content discovery aligned with the Turkish Ministry of National Education curriculum.

## Getting Started

We are currently in the **Alpha / MVP Development** phase.

### Main Repository

- **[ELT-Hive/platform](https://github.com/ELT-Hive/platform)**: The core web application (Frontend + Backend logic).

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, and teachers!

1.  **Developers:** Help us build the Exam Builder and Remix engine. Check out the `Issues` tab in our platform repo.
2.  **Designers:** We need user-friendly UI/UX for non-tech-savvy teachers.
3.  **Teachers:** Your feedback on features is invaluable.

Please use **GitHub Discussions** or **Issues** in the platform repository for all communications and feature requests.
